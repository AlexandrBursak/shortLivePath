# T18 — Verify canary confidentiality and fault-recovery boundaries

## Place in the sequence

- Blocked by: T17 — Wire same-origin deployment and confidentiality controls. Blocks: T20 — Measure workload budgets and install aggregate synthetic checks. Wave: 14 (dependency depth, not elapsed days).

- Lane: T3 share files_hint; serialize overlapping changes, including shared route/registry/canon files.

Planning gate: T1 source-policy synchronization is complete under Accepted ADR-0006/0007. T2 must still resolve DM-OQ-02…04 before implementation and affected snapshots must be refreshed afterward. T21 benchmarks after T3, not before scaffolding. No runtime/security approval follows from T1 completion.

## Why (user story)

> **As a** Recipient
> **I want** the Secret to become unavailable after expiration and to understand what that means
> **So that** I do not mistake a temporary sharing window for revocation of external credentials or deletion of copies I saved.

This task contributes: Verify canary confidentiality and fault-recovery boundaries.

## Inlined context

> Content is sent over HTTPS and may be read and processed by the service while retained. Expiration stops further disclosure and removes stored Secret data. Operator-blind browser encryption is not a requirement.
>
> — `spec.md §1, committed approach, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


> Thin AdonisJS controllers validate and delegate to services; services own lifecycle rules, Redis access and Lucid metadata operations. The browser uses typed data-layer clients and renders Secret text as inert text, never HTML or a redirect. No recipient identity/list or ownership-management module is introduced.
>
> — `sad.md §5, module boundaries, abridged` · full text: [sad.md](../sad.md)


> **Admission and failure semantics.** At most 25 successful creations per rolling sixty-second address window and 1000 active Secrets are allowed, with Redis maxmemory 256 MiB/noeviction and at most 10,000 limiter records including reservations. People sharing a public address share its quota.
>
> — `sad.md §6, S2, abridged` · full text: [sad.md](../sad.md)


> **Concurrent-attempt semantics.** Each link/address pair admits no more in-flight verifications than its remaining failure allowance, so simultaneous wrong codes cannot overshoot five failed verifications in any rolling sixty-second window. Occupied in-flight slots may temporarily refuse even a correct attempt without running its hash.
>
> — `sad.md §6, S4, abridged` · full text: [sad.md](../sad.md)


> **Retention and outage boundaries.** Active Secret/verifier data must be removed within sixty seconds of expiration while Redis can execute cleanup. The five-second tick and TTL are supporting mechanisms, not proof of that bound.
>
> — `sad.md §6, S7, abridged` · full text: [sad.md](../sad.md)


> **Chosen:** Option 2. AdonisJS may process Secret text and Reading codes over HTTPS.

Fallback: if an inline is insufficient, outdated or contradicts code, open its named source and follow it; never invent missing parameters. Proposed code paths below are planned targets, not claims of existing imports/APIs.

## Acceptance criteria

Coverage is this task’s contribution, not a claim that prerequisite/whole-system AC behavior is already implemented.

### AC-07

> **Given** a Secret requires a Reading code
> **When** a Recipient attempts reading without the correct code
> **Then** no Secret content can be seen or copied; the correct code permits reading only while the Share link remains valid. A wrong code does not permanently consume or invalidate the Share link. After five incorrect code verifications in any rolling sixty-second window for the same Share link and client network address, further code verification for that pair is temporarily denied until fewer than five failures remain in that window. Rejected requests do not extend the window. Other addresses are not blocked by that pair's failures; people behind one network address share its limit. Store only a code verification hash, not the plaintext code. This is basic online protection, not a guarantee against distributed guessing; atomic concurrency controls and the bounded hash implementation remain design obligations. Disclosure accepts shorter code guesses, including an explicitly supplied empty code, within the same 1024 UTF-8 byte maximum. Invalid or oversized input and temporary work-capacity refusals do not run code verification or count as an incorrect-code failure.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-07, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-09

> **Given** a Share link is invalid or unavailable
> **When** the Recipient opens it
> **Then** a safe unavailability message contains no Secret fragments; simply viewing a page never consumes a valid Share link. For a known expired link, opening the original URL shows an explicit expired state rather than a missing-page/404 experience. Persist minimal link lifecycle metadata indefinitely for now so this distinction survives Secret deletion and Redis restarts. An unknown link remains safely unavailable. If a known unexpired link has lost its Secret, explain early unavailability, not expiration or recovery.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-09, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-10

> **Given** a Share link has reached expiration
> **When** a Recipient attempts a new disclosure, including with the correct Reading code
> **Then** the service refuses to release Secret data at or after expiration, checking the time immediately before release rather than only when reading begins. The normal application checks expiration before display and must not show a response that arrives after expiration. A running page hides displayed content locally at expiration even without network access; after suspension or a return to the page it checks expiration before redisplaying content. This is a normal-application guarantee, not remote revocation of plaintext or ciphertext and keys already obtained by a Recipient. Data released before expiration cannot be recalled while in transit.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-10, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-11

> **Given** a Secret has expired
> **When** the service applies its retention policy
> **Then** active stored Secret data is removed within sixty seconds of expiration while Redis is running and able to execute cleanup. During process or virtual-machine suspension/hang, physical removal from memory within that interval is not guaranteed; after recovery, expired records are cleared before serving Secret traffic resumes. The service never releases expired data, independently of cleanup. Secret records have no disk persistence, backups or recovery; Secret content, Reading codes, and full Share links are absent from logs and backups. Removal means deletion from active service storage, not guaranteed forensic zeroization of RAM.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-11, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-11b

> **Given** a crash or restart has removed a Secret before its scheduled expiration
> **When** a Recipient attempts to show it
> **Then** the page explains that the Secret is unavailable, reveals no content, and does not offer recovery; a new Share link must be requested from the Sender.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-11b, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


## Checklist

- [ ] Create disposable canary payloads/codes/tokens, exercise success/refusal/errors, and inspect proxy/app/datastore/telemetry/cache/disk/backup artifacts without printing sensitive test values. Work area: `backend/tests/security/` (and matching files_hint targets).

- [ ] Test metadata-only backup/restore, empty Redis restart, original expired recognition and unexpired early loss. Never restore payloads or verifiers. Work area: `backend/tests/integration/faults/` (and matching files_hint targets).

- [ ] Fault-inject uncertain PG/Redis commits, runtime/OOM script errors, duplicate maintenance and stale generations, clock rollback and suspension beyond 60s; independently measure running-cleanup deletion bound. Work area: `scripts/verify_retention/` (and matching files_hint targets).

- [ ] Record actual runtime and host retention evidence and unresolved launch controls; do not mark independent security approval or production compliance from local tests. Work area: `docs/features/short-live-path/_audit/runtime-security.md` (and matching files_hint targets).

- [ ] Write the named tests first (RED), then implement and pass GREEN; for decision tasks use executable evidence/review vectors rather than claiming runtime success from prose.

## Edge cases

| Case | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| PG outage while Redis executes | Retain closed readiness but keep cleanup and measure its deadline. |
| Suspended VM holds old memory | No physical-zeroization claim; verify closed recovery ordering. |

Edge-case sources: [spec.md](../spec.md) §5, AC-07, AC-09, AC-10, AC-11, AC-11b, abridged; [sad.md](../sad.md) §6, S2, S4, S7, abridged. Decisions T1/T2 also follow [data-model.md](../data-model.md) §Open technical decisions, DM-OQ-01…05, abridged.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Canary audit has zero payload/code/full-link log/backup hits; fault suites prove no late releases, <=60s deletion while cleanup executes and cleanup-before-serving, or explicitly block launch with evidence.

- [ ] All inlined hard rules still hold; tests cite their AC IDs.

- [ ] Installed application test/lint/typecheck/build gates pass for touched code; decision-only tasks pass artifact validation and recorded review instead.

- [ ] Stay within one working day; split/replan if the change exceeds roughly 500 LOC. Never close unresolved safety choices as done.
