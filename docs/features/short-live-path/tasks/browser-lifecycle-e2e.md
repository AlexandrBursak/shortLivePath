# T19 — Verify all screens, exact copies and browser lifecycle safety

## Place in the sequence

- Blocked by: T17 — Wire same-origin deployment and confidentiality controls. Blocks: T20 — Measure workload budgets and install aggregate synthetic checks. Wave: 14 (dependency depth, not elapsed days).

- Lane: T4 share files_hint; serialize overlapping changes, including shared route/registry/canon files.

Planning gate: T1 source-policy synchronization is complete under Accepted ADR-0006/0007. T2 must still resolve DM-OQ-02…04 before implementation and affected snapshots must be refreshed afterward. T21 benchmarks after T3, not before scaffolding. No runtime/security approval follows from T1 completion.

## Why (user story)

> **As a** Recipient
> **I want** to open a neutral Share link page, provide a Reading code when required, explicitly choose Show, copy the Secret, and return before expiration
> **So that** I can use the supplied access details without registering.

This task contributes: Verify all screens, exact copies and browser lifecycle safety.

## Inlined context

> Content is sent over HTTPS and may be read and processed by the service while retained. Expiration stops further disclosure and removes stored Secret data. Operator-blind browser encryption is not a requirement.
>
> — `spec.md §1, committed approach, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


> Thin AdonisJS controllers validate and delegate to services; services own lifecycle rules, Redis access and Lucid metadata operations. The browser uses typed data-layer clients and renders Secret text as inert text, never HTML or a redirect. No recipient identity/list or ownership-management module is introduced.
>
> — `sad.md §5, module boundaries, abridged` · full text: [sad.md](../sad.md)


> **Timing and scope obligations.** Expiration is the selected duration after successful creation, not form entry or initial reservation. The messages above state the approved cross-store order, not a concrete timestamp-publication algorithm: §11 still requires the exact creation-time anchor, final timestamp publication and atomic successful-quota accounting to be resolved and tested before implementation.
>
> — `sad.md §6, S1, abridged` · full text: [sad.md](../sad.md)


> **Status boundaries.** Neutral status does not decrement a view count, verify a Reading code, change expiration or persist a recipient identity. Read-only availability inspection is not permission to serialize payload fields into a status response, neutral HTML, preview, logs or cache.
>
> — `sad.md §6, S3, abridged` · full text: [sad.md](../sad.md)


> **Concurrent-attempt semantics.** Each link/address pair admits no more in-flight verifications than its remaining failure allowance, so simultaneous wrong codes cannot overshoot five failed verifications in any rolling sixty-second window. Occupied in-flight slots may temporarily refuse even a correct attempt without running its hash.
>
> — `sad.md §6, S4, abridged` · full text: [sad.md](../sad.md)


> **Browser and copy boundaries.** Copy helpers pass the original field string without trimming, newline conversion, Unicode normalization or formatting. Manual selection is a fallback while the same text remains eligible, not a download, stored draft or recovery feature.
>
> — `sad.md §6, S5, abridged` · full text: [sad.md](../sad.md)


> **Time and lifecycle obligations.** The countdown is presentation, never permission to bypass S4's final service-side release check. Device wall-clock changes cannot extend the lifetime.

Fallback: if an inline is insufficient, outdated or contradicts code, open its named source and follow it; never invent missing parameters. Proposed code paths below are planned targets, not claims of existing imports/APIs.

## Acceptance criteria

Coverage is this task’s contribution, not a claim that prerequisite/whole-system AC behavior is already implemented.

### AC-01

> **Given** a Sender has entered a valid Secret
> **When** the Sender successfully creates it
> **Then** the Sender receives a copyable Share link and a confirmed expiration time without registration.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-01, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-02

> **Given** a Sender has omitted the password or key, provided only whitespace in that field, or entered more than 64 KiB of Secret text
> **When** the Sender attempts creation
> **Then** creation is blocked with a plain-language explanation and no Share link is issued. The 64 KiB limit counts the sum of the UTF-8 encoded address, login, and password or key text, excluding the Reading code and packaging overhead. Nonempty password or key text is preserved verbatim, not trimmed or normalized.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-02, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-03

> **Given** a Secret contains a multiline key
> **When** the Recipient reads and copies it before expiration
> **Then** its characters, spaces, and line breaks are preserved without alteration.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-03, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-04

> **Given** a Sender is creating a Secret
> **When** creation succeeds with the default lifetime or a chosen whole number of minutes from 1 to 1440
> **Then** expiration is one hour after successful creation by default, or the chosen duration after successful creation. The service establishes the creation and expiration times; changing the Recipient device clock must not extend the sharing window. The Sender can select every whole-minute value in this range with hour-snapping assistance; selecting a non-hour duration remains possible. The exact interaction is owned by screens and must not silently remove minute-level choices. The confirmation and reading experiences show a visible countdown of remaining lifetime based on service-established expiration and service time; changing the device wall clock does not extend access. Countdown display does not replace server-side expiration enforcement.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-04, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-05

> **Given** a Sender has entered a lifetime shorter than one minute, longer than twenty-four hours, or not a whole number of minutes
> **When** the Sender attempts creation
> **Then** creation is blocked and the permitted lifetime bounds are explained.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-05, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-06

> **Given** a Sender enables a Reading code
> **When** the Sender chooses a code or requests random generation
> **Then** creation requires at least six Unicode code points of any composition, longer codes are allowed up to 1024 UTF-8 bytes, random generation produces twenty characters drawn from Latin letters and digits, and the Reading code is not included in the Share link. There is no character-class or complexity requirement; an informational weak-code warning does not block creation. A chosen code is compared exactly, including case and spaces, without trimming or normalization. A code over this byte limit is rejected with an explanation, never truncated, and does not create a link.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-06, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-07

> **Given** a Secret requires a Reading code
> **When** a Recipient attempts reading without the correct code
> **Then** no Secret content can be seen or copied; the correct code permits reading only while the Share link remains valid. A wrong code does not permanently consume or invalidate the Share link. After five incorrect code verifications in any rolling sixty-second window for the same Share link and client network address, further code verification for that pair is temporarily denied until fewer than five failures remain in that window. Rejected requests do not extend the window. Other addresses are not blocked by that pair's failures; people behind one network address share its limit. Store only a code verification hash, not the plaintext code. This is basic online protection, not a guarantee against distributed guessing; atomic concurrency controls and the bounded hash implementation remain design obligations. Disclosure accepts shorter code guesses, including an explicitly supplied empty code, within the same 1024 UTF-8 byte maximum. Invalid or oversized input and temporary work-capacity refusals do not run code verification or count as an incorrect-code failure.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-07, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-08

> **Given** a Share link has not expired and its reading conditions are satisfied
> **When** the Recipient explicitly chooses Show on the neutral page, on an initial or repeat visit
> **Then** the Recipient can read and copy the Secret without registration while it remains available and unexpired. Opening the page alone reveals no Secret content, including in previews. Concurrent reading is permitted; no visit consumes the link.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-08, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-09

> **Given** a Share link is invalid or unavailable
> **When** the Recipient opens it
> **Then** a safe unavailability message contains no Secret fragments; simply viewing a page never consumes a valid Share link. For a known expired link, opening the original URL shows an explicit expired state rather than a missing-page/404 experience. Persist minimal link lifecycle metadata indefinitely for now so this distinction survives Secret deletion and Redis restarts. An unknown link remains safely unavailable. If a known unexpired link has lost its Secret, explain early unavailability, not expiration or recovery.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-09, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-10

> **Given** a Share link has reached expiration
> **When** a Recipient attempts a new disclosure, including with the correct Reading code
> **Then** the service refuses to release Secret data at or after expiration, checking the time immediately before release rather than only when reading begins. The normal application checks expiration before display and must not show a response that arrives after expiration. A running page hides displayed content locally at expiration even without network access; after suspension or a return to the page it checks expiration before redisplaying content. This is a normal-application guarantee, not remote revocation of plaintext or ciphertext and keys already obtained by a Recipient. Data released before expiration cannot be recalled while in transit.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-10, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-11b

> **Given** a crash or restart has removed a Secret before its scheduled expiration
> **When** a Recipient attempts to show it
> **Then** the page explains that the Secret is unavailable, reveals no content, and does not offer recovery; a new Share link must be requested from the Sender.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-11b, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


### AC-12

> **Given** a Recipient has copied external access details and the Share link later expires
> **When** the Recipient checks what expiration means
> **Then** the service explains that it does not change external passwords or revoke external server keys, and does not claim to erase saved copies.
>
> — `spec.md §5, AC-12, verbatim` · full text: [spec.md](../spec.md)


## Checklist

- [ ] Run the approved plan-tests browser/version profile across all SCR-01…05 states at 360px and desktop, including complete keyboard flows, labels/focus and safe announcements. Work area: `frontend/tests/e2e/` (and matching files_hint targets).

- [ ] Exercise actual API-backed create/status/Show/copy, all minute choices including 61, repeat/concurrent readers, code throttling and exact multibyte/multiline clipboard strings. Work area: `frontend/tests/accessibility/` (and matching files_hint targets).

- [ ] Delay responses and clipboard completions through expiry; test offline local hiding, wall-clock changes, background/pagehide/freeze/BFCache/suspend-return with concealment and fresh Show. Work area: `docs/features/short-live-path/_audit/browser-verification.md` (and matching files_hint targets).

- [ ] Collect safe screenshots/console results without canary Secret/code/capability exposure; report unsupported automation or platform cases honestly. Work area: `docs/features/short-live-path/_audit/browser-verification.md` (and matching files_hint targets).

- [ ] Write the named tests first (RED), then implement and pass GREEN; for decision tasks use executable evidence/review vectors rather than claiming runtime success from prose.

## Edge cases

| Case | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| API response arrives after deadline | Never display or copy it. |
| Clipboard denied | Accessible exact manual selection only while eligible. |

Edge-case sources: [spec.md](../spec.md) §5, AC-01, AC-02, AC-03, AC-04, AC-05, AC-06, AC-07, AC-08, AC-09, AC-10, AC-11b, AC-12, abridged; [sad.md](../sad.md) §6, S1, S3, S4, S5, S6, abridged. Decisions T1/T2 also follow [data-model.md](../data-model.md) §Open technical decisions, DM-OQ-01…05, abridged.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] AC-citing E2E/accessibility tests pass on the approved narrow/desktop browser matrix with zero app console errors, no automatic disclosure and no stale/late plaintext after lifecycle transitions.

- [ ] All inlined hard rules still hold; tests cite their AC IDs.

- [ ] Installed application test/lint/typecheck/build gates pass for touched code; decision-only tasks pass artifact validation and recorded review instead.

- [ ] Stay within one working day; split/replan if the change exceeds roughly 500 LOC. Never close unresolved safety choices as done.
